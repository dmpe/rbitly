\title{Expand a short URL to a longer one}
\usage{
isgd_LinksExpand(shorturl = "", showRequestURL = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shorturl}{- (optional character) You can specify the shorturl parameter if you'd like to
pick a shortened URL instead of having is.gd randomly generate one. These must be between 5 and 30 
characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. Shortened URLs 
are case sensitive. Bear in mind that a desired short URL might already be taken (this is very 
often the case with common words) so if you're using this option be prepared to respond to an 
error and get an alternative choice from your app's user.}

\item{showRequestURL}{- show URL which has been build and requested from server. 
For debug purposes.}
